I followed [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBxNd-E2sP0) to make hand-pulled noodles at home. The dough is simple. Three ingredients: flour, water, salt. Mix it, let it rest, and you're done with the dough preparation.

The pulling technique takes a little practice. Your first attempt will work, and the noodles will taste excellent even if they're not perfectly uniform.

For the sauce, you can substitute ingredients as needed to match your preferences. The video mentions blooming the spices for that sizzle, but if you're using good spices you can skip that step. Homemade hand-pulled noodles are worth making.
