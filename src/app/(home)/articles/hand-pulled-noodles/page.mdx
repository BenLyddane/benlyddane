I watched videos of people making hand-pulled noodles and assumed it would be incredibly intimidating. Don't people need to be experts for this? Couldn't be more wrong.

I followed [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBxNd-E2sP0). The dough is dead simple. Three ingredients. Flour, water, salt. Mix it, let it rest, you're done with the hard part.

The pulling technique? Sure, takes a little practice. But your first attempt will work. The noodles won't be perfectly uniform. They'll still taste better than anything you can buy at the store.

For the sauce, you can substitute as much or as little as necessary for a sauce you like and it will still be delicious. The video mentions blooming the spices for that sizzle, but if you're using good spices you don't even have to. Don't be afraid of homemade hand-pulled noodles.
