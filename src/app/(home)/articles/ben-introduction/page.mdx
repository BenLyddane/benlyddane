I needed a place to write about what I'm learning and building. This is it.

I've worked on experimental government projects, provided equipment for NYC skyscrapers, taught myself web development, and started companies. The pattern is the same: find something interesting, learn enough to be useful, apply it.

Most of what I write here is documenting that process. How I approach learning new skills. What I'm building. Mistakes I've made. Things that worked.

Some of it's technical (engineering, coding, construction). Some of it's not (gaming, food, general thoughts). The common thread is learning and applying knowledge across different domains.
